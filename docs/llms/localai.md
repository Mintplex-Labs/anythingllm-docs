[LocalAI](https://localai.io) is a popular [open-source](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI), API, and LLM engine that allows you to download and run any GGUF model from HuggingFace and run it on CPU or GPU. LocalAI supports both LLMs, Embedding models, and image-generation models. LocalAI is a Docker container image that you must configure and run.

You can update your model to a different model at any time in the **Settings**.
