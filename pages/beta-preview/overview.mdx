# What are beta previews?

Beta previews of AnythingLLM are versions _or_ features of AnythingLLM that are either:

- In active development
- Unstable or untested
- Features that are not fully completed, but are looking for feedback from the community.

# Types of beta previews

There a few ways we may publish beta previews of AnythingLLM:

- As a fully separated Docker image
- A special publication of the [desktop application](/installation/desktop/macos)
- A hidden feature already present in the AnythingLLM Application

# How can I access a beta preview or feature?
