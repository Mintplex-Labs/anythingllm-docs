## Installing the application

<Callout type="warning" emoji="️⚠️">
  We **do not** recommend installing AnythingLLM Desktop for "all users" on a Windows machine.
  Instead, install for "Current User" only. Installing for all users will cause issues with the app and is not supported.
</Callout>

After downloading the windows `exe` installer for AnythingLLM, you can double-click the installer and it will display the installation process.

After which, now the regular installer can run to install AnythingLLM Desktop!

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Local LLM support**

➤ AnythingLLM desktop includes a built-in local LLM powered via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). This is a super convenient way to get started with LLMs without any additional setup.

In order for AnythingLLM to leverage your GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) or even NPU we need to install some extra dependencies. This will be done automatically during installation.

If these extra dependencies are not installed, you will see a warning in the UI and you will get reduced performance for local LLMs since you will be limited to CPU processing.

</Callout>

Click on the application name "**AnythingLLM**" on your desktop to boot up AnythingLLM!

_your first boot may take a minute or two to complete on some systems, but subsequent boots will be near instant._

If you are trying to install AnythingLLM and you are getting an error that says "AnythingLLM cannot be closed" during installation the following steps will solve your issue.

1. **You previously installed AnythingLLM and it is still running in the background.**

 - Since v1.11.0, AnythingLLM minimizes to the system tray when closed. Check your system tray for the AnythingLLM icon and click on it. "Quit AnythingLLM" to close it.
 - You can then click on "Retry" and the installation will continue.

2. **You previously installed AnythingLLM for all users instead of just the current user.**

 - Prior to v1.11.0, AnythingLLM was allowed to be installed for all users. This is no longer the case - this can cause issues during installation since you must run the installer as administrator to uninstall programs from your primary drive.
 - To fix this, you must uninstall AnythingLLM for all users and then reinstall for the current user only. Right- Click on the AnythingLLM Desktop icon and click "Open File Location" to open the installation folder.
 - Click on the "Uninstall AnythingLLM.exe" file and run it. You may or may not have to run it as administrator.
 - After uninstalling, you can then reinstall for the current user only.

 **Performing the above steps WILL NOT remove your data or settings. You can do this safely without losing any of your data.**
