  **Local LLM support**

➤ AnythingLLM desktop includes a built-in local LLM powered via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). This is a super convenient way to get started with LLMs without any additional setup.

In order for AnythingLLM to leverage your GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) or even NPU we need to install some extra dependencies. This will be done automatically during installation.

If these extra dependencies are not installed, you will see a warning in the UI and you will get reduced performance for local LLMs since you will be limited to CPU processing.

[Read this on how to manually install the dependencies if the automatic installation fails](./manual-install.mdx)
