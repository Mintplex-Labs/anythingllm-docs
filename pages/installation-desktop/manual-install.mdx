  **Note:** This documentation is for Windows only and should only be used if you are experiencing issues with the automatic dependency installation
  that occurs during the installation process of the AnythingLLM Desktop executable.
</Callout>

When installing AnythingLLM Desktop on Windows you may have been notified that external dependencies were missing. This is because AnythingLLM Desktop uses a local LLM powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) which requires some additional dependencies to be installed on your system.
Since we do not include these dependencies in the AnythingLLM Desktop executable to keep the file size small, we download them from a hosted S3 bucket during the installation process.

If you are in a geographic region that is restricted from accessing the S3 bucket automatically during the installation process (like VPN related), you can manually install the dependencies using the below instructions.

## Manual Dependency Installation

### Download the Dependency Bundle

Download the [bundle](https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.useanything.com/support/ollama/win32_lib.zip) from the AnythingLLM S3 bucket. 

_direct link:_ https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.useanything.com/support/ollama/win32_lib.zip

### Extract the Dependency Bundle

Right-click > Extract files to a folder called `win32_lib` on your desktop. It should suggest this default folder name.

### Copy the Dependency Bundle to the AnythingLLM Desktop Application

Open the `Program Files` for the installed AnythingLLM Desktop application. This is typically located at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\AnythingLLM`.

Open the `resources/ollama` folder inside the AnythingLLM Desktop application folder.

Open the `win32_lib` folder created during the extraction of the zip file. Inside this folder you will see a folder called `lib`.

Copy the `lib` folder and paste it into the `ollama` folder inside the AnythingLLM Desktop application folder.

You should now be able to run the AnythingLLM Desktop internal LLM with full GPU,CPU,NPU support.

## Alternative: Install Ollama Directly
If you cannot unable to access the S3 bucket at all on your internet connection, you should just install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) directly and select that LLM as your provider in AnythingLLM.
