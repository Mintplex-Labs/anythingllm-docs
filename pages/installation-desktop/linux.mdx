# Linux Installation

**1. Install using the [installer script](#install-using-the-installer-script)**

## Install using the installer script

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **NOTICE**

➤ AnythingLLM packages as an AppImage but you **will not** be able to boot if you run just the AppImage. Please only use the script below.

➤ Please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/issues) if you have installation or bootup troubles.

</Callout>

First, open a terminal on your Linux machine and run this command.

```shell copy
curl -fsSL https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.useanything.com/latest/installer.sh | sh
```

You can view the raw script contents [here](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/blob/desktop/linux_installer.sh).

This will download the latest version of AnythingLLM's AppImage, unpack it, and then supply a symlink to seamlessly run AnythingLLM.
This script will unpack the app in `$HOME/AnythingLLMDesktop`.

You can start the app at any time by running `./AnythingLLMDesktop/start`. This will boot the app with full logging.
