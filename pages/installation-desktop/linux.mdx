## Install using the installer script

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Heads up!**

➤ The AnythingLLM Desktop app is packaged as an AppImage and is available for **x64** and **arm64** architectures.

➤ The Linux Arm64 AppImage is currently only available for AnythingLLM Desktop **1.9.0** and higher.

➤ Please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/issues) if you have installation or bootup troubles.

</Callout>

First, open a terminal on your Linux machine and run this command.

```shell copy
# Download the installer script to wherever you want to run it from
curl -fsSL https://cdn.anythingllm.com/latest/installer.sh -o installer.sh

# Make the script executable
chmod +x installer.sh

# Run the script
./installer.sh
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
By default, the installer will download the appropriate architecture of AnythingLLM Desktop for your system into the `$HOME` directory. If you wish to install to a different location, set the `ANYTHING_LLM_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable before running the installer.

You can also re-run the installer script to update the app to the latest version as new versions are released.
</Callout>

This will download the latest version of AnythingLLM's AppImage as well as **ask to create** the Ubuntu `apparmor` rule to allow the app to run
without any additional configuration. **You need to create an `apparmor` rule to allow the app to run or else you will run into SUID issues during bootup.**

Lastly, it will create a simple `.desktop` file so the app can be launched from the desktop and pinned to the launcher.

You can start the app via the UI or from the command line at any time by running `./AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage`. This will boot the app with full logging.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall AnythingLLM, you can run the following commands:

```shell
# Remove the installer script
rm installer.sh

# Remove the AppImage
rm AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage

# Remove the .desktop file
rm ~/.local/share/applications/anythingllmdesktop.desktop

# Remove the apparmor rules
sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/anythingllmdesktop

# Remove the app data fully
rm -rf ~/.config/anythingllm-desktop
```
