# AI Agents

Agents are basically an LLM that has access to some simple tools. We will be adding much more customization in this area soon, but basically the work inside a workspace.

You can start an agent session by going into any workspace and typing `@agent <your prompt>` and exit by just typing `exit`

Agents can scrape websites, list and summarize your documents, search the web, make charts, and even save files to desktop and their own memory.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Examples:** <br />
    1: `@agent` what documents can you see - > LLM will "look" at what are the documents it can see

    2: `@agent` summarize readme.pdf - > LLM will summarize that specific embedded file
</Callout>
