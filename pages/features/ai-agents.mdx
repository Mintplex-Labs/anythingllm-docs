# AI Agents

Agents are basically an LLM that has access to some simple tools. We will be adding much more customization in this area soon. All agents share the same tools across workspaces, but operate within the workspace they were invoked via `@agent`.

You can start an agent session by going into any workspace and typing `@agent <your prompt>` and exit by just typing `exit`

Agents can scrape websites, list and summarize your documents, search the web, make charts, and even save files to desktop and their own memory.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Examples:** <br />
    1: `@agent` what documents can you see - > LLM will "look" at what are the documents it can see

    2: `@agent` summarize readme.pdf - > LLM will summarize that specific embedded file
