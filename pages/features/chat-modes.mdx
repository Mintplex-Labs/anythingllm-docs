# Chat Modes in AnythingLLM

AnythingLLM offers two ways to chat with your documents: Query mode and Chat mode. Let's understand what each does and how to get the best results.

## Query Mode vs Chat Mode

**Query Mode**:
- Only uses information from your uploaded documents
- Will tell you if it can't find relevant information
- Best for when you need accurate, document-based answers

**Chat Mode**:
- Uses both your documents and the AI's general knowledge
- More conversational and flexible
- Good for brainstorming and exploring topics

## Common Questions

### "It keeps saying 'No relevant information found' in Query mode"

This usually means one of three things:
1. The information might be in your document but worded differently
2. The similarity settings might be too strict
3. The document might be too large and split in a way that makes finding information difficult

**Quick fixes to try:**
1. Go to workspace settings → Vector Database Settings
2. Change "Document similarity threshold" to "No restriction"
3. Try asking your question using words that match how it's written in your document

  Instead of asking "How do I start the app?", try using terms from your document like "How do I initialize the application?"

### "When should I use Query mode vs Chat mode?"

Use **Query mode** when:
- You need factual answers from your documents
- You're working with technical documentation
- You want to prevent made-up information

Use **Chat mode** when:
- You want more conversational responses
- You need additional context or examples
- You're brainstorming ideas

### "Why does it work better with some documents than others?"

Documents are processed in chunks, and each chunk is analyzed separately. This means:
- Large documents might need more specific questions
- Technical documents work better with technical questions

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Query mode** and "No restriction" similarity if you're not finding information
2. **Use specific terms** from your documents in your questions
3. **Switch to Chat mode** if you need more context or explanation
4. **Try rephrasing your question** if you're not getting good results

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you're still not getting good results, check your workspace settings and try adjusting the "Document similarity threshold" between No restriction, Low (≥ .25), Medium (≥ .50), or High (≥ .75) to find what works best for your documents.
