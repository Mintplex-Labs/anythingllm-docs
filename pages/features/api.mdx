# API Access & Keys

You can find the API documentation for available endpoints on your instance at `/api/docs`

API keys are managed by accounts with the correct access level.

However, anyone with the API key can use the AnythingLLM API, so do not share or publish this key anywhere.

AnythingLLM supports a full developer API that you can use to manage, update, embed, and even chat with your workspaces.

You can create and delete API keys on the fly if you are allowed permission to do so.
