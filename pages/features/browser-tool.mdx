# Private Browser Tool

The Private Browser Tool enables you to access and scrape content from websites that require authentication, such as LinkedIn profiles or internal company portals. It provides a secure, isolated browser environment that maintains your login sessions while keeping credentials safely stored on your local machine.

## Key Features

- **Secure Session Storage**: Credentials are stored locally using isolated browser sessions
- **Session Persistence**: Login sessions persist between app restarts until explicitly cleared
- **Isolated Environment**: Separate from your main browser and AnythingLLM's main session
- **Full User Control**: Clear stored data at any time with a single click

## Using the Private Browser

### Accessing the Tool
1. Open AnythingLLM Desktop
2. Navigate to Settings > Tools > Browser Tool
3. Click "Open Private Browser" to launch the isolated browser window

### Authentication Process
1. Log into your desired service (e.g., LinkedIn, Gmail) through the Private Browser
2. Your session will persist until you explicitly clear the browser data
3. AnythingLLM can now access authenticated content from these services when scraping

  **Security Note**
  All credentials and session data are stored locally on your machine. AnythingLLM never transmits or stores your login information in the cloud.

### Managing Browser Data

- **Clearing Data**: Use the "Clear Browser Data" button to remove all stored credentials and sessions
- **When to Clear**:
  - After completing your scraping tasks
  - When switching between different service accounts
  - If you encounter authentication issues

## Common Use Cases

- Scraping protected LinkedIn profiles
- Accessing internal company documentation
- Collecting data from authenticated web services
- Scraping content from behind login walls

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Clear the browser data and try again
2. Ensure you're fully logged into the service
3. Check if the service allows automated access
4. Restart the AnythingLLM Desktop application
