# What is the AnythingLLM Community Hub?

The [AnythingLLM Community Hub](https://hub.anythingllm.com) is a platform and marketplace for AnythingLLM users to share system prompts, slash commands, agent skills, and more.

The community hub enables you to share your own items, skills, and workflows with the AnythingLLM community both **publicly** and **privately**.

Currently, the AnythingLLM Community Hub is in **beta** and as such, not all types of items are supported.

### Current Supported Item Types

- [x] Agent Skills

- [x] Slash Commands

_More item types are coming soon!_  
- [ ] Workspaces
- [ ] Data Connectors
- [ ] Authentication Providers
