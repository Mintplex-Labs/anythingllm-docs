<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Tip** ➤➤ On linux `http://host.docker.internal:xxxx` does not work. Use
  `http://172.17.0.1:xxxx` instead to emulate this functionality.

## What's the difference between Ollama and the AnythingLLM LLM provider? (Desktop Only)

You can either choose to run Ollama on your own or use the built in AnythingLLM LLM provider. If you use the AnythingLLM provider, a separate instance of Ollama is being run under the hood. This is why if you download models into the version of Ollama that you are running separate from AnythingLLM, it will not show those models as downloaded in the AnythingLLM LLM provider.
