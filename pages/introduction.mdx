# What is AnythingLLM?

AnythingLLM is the easiest to use, **all-in-one** AI application that can do RAG, AI Agents, and much more with no code or infrastructure headaches.

AnythingLLM is built by [Mintplex Labs, Inc](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs) - founded by [Timothy Carambat](https://twitter.com/tcarambat) and went through [YCombinator Summer 2022](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mintplex-labs).

AnythingLLM is **not a one-person project**. The Mintplex Labs team also includes:

- Sean Hatfield (Engineer)
- Tiff Tang (Designer)
- Our community of volunteer contributors
- [You?](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mintplex-labs/jobs)

# Why use AnythingLLM?

You want a **zero-setup**, **private**, and all-in-one AI application for local LLMs, RAG, and AI Agents all in one place without painful developer-required set up.

_or_

You need a **fully-customizable**, **private**, and all-in-one AI app for your _business or organization_ that is basically a full ChatGPT with permissioning but with any LLM, embedding model, or vector database.
