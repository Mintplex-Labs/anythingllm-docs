## Available Images

### `latest`

- **Deployment Frequency:** On every commit to the `master` branch
- **Pull Command:** `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:latest`

The latest image is the most recent version of AnythingLLM. It is updated on a near-daily basis and will always be up to date with the latest features and bug fixes
that are committed to the `master` branch in the [AnythingLLM GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm).


### `v*.*.*`

- **Architecture:** `amd64` & `arm64`
- **Deployment Frequency:** On new releases
- **Pull Command:** `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:v*.*.*`

The `v*.*.*` images are the pinned versioned releases of AnythingLLM. These images are published when a new release is made - you can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/releases).

### `render` or `railway`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="️💡">
  **Warning:** You **should only** specify this image if you are deploying AnythingLLM via [Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm&branch=render) or [Railway](https://railway.app/template/HNSCS1?referralCode=WFgJkn).
</Callout>

- **Architecture:** `amd64`
- **Deployment Frequency:** On new releases
- **Pull Command:** `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:render`

The `render` or `railway` images are the latest versions of AnythingLLM and are in sync with the [**versioned** releases of AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/releases).

### `pg`

- **Architecture:** `amd64` & `arm64`
- **Deployment Frequency:** On new releases
- **Pull Command:** `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:pg`

The `pg` image is the latest version of AnythingLLM that are **specifically** built to use with a local or remote PostgreSQL database.

This image has a slightly different startup command to support the PostgreSQL deployment and does the following:
- Will store all AnythingLLM data in the PostgreSQL database
- Will by default use **PGVector** for vector storage - **requires** a PGVector extension to be installed on the PostgreSQL database

See the [PostgreSQL image deployment command](/installation-docker/quickstart#pg-image-startup-command) for more information.
