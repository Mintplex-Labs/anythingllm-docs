## Installation Overview

AnythingLLM Docker is both a **single-user** and **multi-user** application you can install on any webserver using docker and leverage local LLMs, RAG, and Agents with little to zero configuration and full privacy.

Self hosting AnythingLLM via Docker is very popular and can be done locally or on cloud servicers (aws, google cloud, railway etc..).

## Docker vs Desktop Version

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Tip:** AnythingLLM Desktop is the easiest way to get started with AnythingLLM.

  If you dont need multi-user support - you should use AnythingLLM Desktop.

There are some distinct differences in functionality between each offering. Both are open source.
