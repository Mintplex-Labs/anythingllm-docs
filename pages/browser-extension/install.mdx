# About the AnythingLLM Browser Extension

<Callout type="info">
  The AnythingLLM Browser Extension is new and is currently only available in the Docker version of AnythingLLM. Support for AnythingLLM desktop will be in versions 1.6.5 and later.

If you do not see the screens below, you may need to update to the latest version of AnythingLLM or are on a version that does not support the browser extension yet.

**The AnythingLLM Browser Extension requires AnythingLLM to be running on an accessible cloud instance or locally on your machine in some form.**

# Customizing the Browser Extension

**_Docker only:_**
By default, the image in the browser extension is the AnythingLLM logo. However, it will automatically use the logo of the instance you are connected to if set in the `Customization` section of the settings page.

If you want to further customize the browser extension, you can do so by forking the [AnythingLLM Browser Extension GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-extension) and making your own changes.

Once you have made your changes, you can build the extension using the `yarn build` command.

After building the extension, you can load it into your browser by clicking the `Load unpacked.` button in Chrome and selecting the `dist` folder.
