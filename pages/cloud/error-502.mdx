### I am getting a 502 on my hosted AnythingLLM!

<Callout type="error" emoji="️⚠️">
  **Notice** This "crash" resulted from your actions on uploading of a document.
  If you upload the same document again it **will crash again**.
</Callout>

**What happened?** You uploaded too large of a document to your instance (word count, not file size) and on your tier likely overwhelmed the CPU causing the process to be killed to prevent the instance from freezing. This same error can occur from uploading _many_ files that are all medium sized at the same time.

Recommendations for maximum file size based on tier:

- **Starter Tier**: 10k words per file
- **Professional Tier**: 50k words per file

### How do I get my instance back up?

- Visit [Your My.Mintplexlabs.com](https://my.mintplexlabs.com/dashboard) account.

Click on your subscription item that is currently offline (Click the gear icon)

  height={500}
  width={500}
  quality={100}
  alt="AnythingLLM Subscription Item"
/>

You will now see a screen that looks like this

<Image
  src="/images/cloud/dashboard.png"
  height={500}
  width={500}
  quality={100}
  alt="AnythingLLM Subscription Dashboard"
/>

Scroll down and you will see a button labeled "Reboot". Clicking this will reboot your instance and it will be available again shortly after.

### How do I prevent this from happening again?

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Pro tip!**

If you have a large amount of really large files you want to embed - using a cloud based embedder will unlock the ability to quickly upload and
use these files with zero concern for overloading of the instance.

</Callout>

There are a few ways to prevent this situation from occurring again.

- Upload smaller documents, one at a time.
- Break larger documents into more "digestible" files.
- [Switch to a cloud based embedder](/anythingllm-setup/embedder-configuration/overview#cloud-model-providers)
