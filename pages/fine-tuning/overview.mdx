# AnythingLLM Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is now available in AnythingLLM as an additional opt-in feature to improve your baseline model responses. Fine-tuning can be a powerful
way to "bake in" knowledge that is specific to your use case into an already great foundational model like LLama 3 8B.

## Why fine-tune?

Fine-tuning and LLM is taking a solid foundational model and improving or "tuning" its behavior, responses, or inherit knowledge based on your AnythingLLM chats and documents.
Combining RAG, agents, and a capable fine-tune is basically an LLM with superpowers.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‼️">
  **Know before you tune!**

Fine-tuning is not the "silver bullet" to bad responses. Fine-tuned LLMs do not guarantee better responses. Like any LLM, your data (chats and documents)
are the key. While a fine-tune may "know" something it was trained on **it is not built for recall and citations.**

</Callout>

## What do I get when I order a fine-tune?

When you order a fine-tuned model via AnythingLLM we **will deliver to you via email** a link to download an 8-bit quantized `.GGUF` file that you can run _anywhere_ you run
LLMs locally. You can load this model directly into AnythingLLM, Ollama, LMStudio, LocalAI, and anywhere else you can run GGUF files.

_This model is yours to keep, forever_.

## How do I get started?

We currently offer in-app fine-tuning where we handle everything for a single one-time fee. This process can deliver you a full fine tune in under 1 hour.
