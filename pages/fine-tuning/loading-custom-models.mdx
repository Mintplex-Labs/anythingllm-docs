# Importing custom LLMs into AnythingLLM

AnythingLLM allows you to easily load into any valid `GGUF` file and select that as your LLM with zero-setup. Please only use text based LLMs
for this process. Embedder and vision models will not function in this capacity.

# Importing an AnythingLLM Fine-Tune

If you ordered or generated and fine-tune via the in-app process you can easily load the model directly into the app via the built-in LLM or via
your preferred local LLM provider like Ollama, LMStudio, LocalAI, and more.

## Import model into AnythingLLM.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‼️">
  **Desktop only!**

This LLM provider is only available in the desktop version. If you are using the browser based version you will need to import the model into your local LLM provider. We recommend
Ollama or LMStudio.

</Callout>

Importing any `GGUF` file into AnythingLLM for use as you LLM is quite simple. On the LLM selection screen you will see an `Import custom model` button.

Clicking this button will open a file picker. Simply select your GGUF file and wait 2-3 minutes while the model is imported. Now you can select and save this
model as your LLM!
