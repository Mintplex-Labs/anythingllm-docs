# AI Agent
Agents are basically an LLM that has access to some simple tools. 

We will be adding much more customization in this area soon. All agents share the same tools across workspaces, but operate within the workspace they were invoked via `@agent`.


## Setting up AI Agents

### 1) Go to Agent configuration
Open the workspace settings and go to the agent configuration menu

### 2) Choose the LLM for your Agent
On workspace settings, select your LLM Provider and the Model you want your Agent to use.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️⚠️">
  **Caution**

    Not all LLM Models works well as Agents, you need to use higher quantization models for better responses.
    Example: `Llama 3 8B 8Bit Quantization Model` gives better responses as an Agent
</Callout>

  **Note**

    Agents supports lot of LLM providers and you can see all the supported LLMs from [here](https://docs.useanything.com/features/language-models#supported-language-model-providers)

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    Some tools like `RAG`, `Summarize Documents` and `Scrape Websites` are enabled by default and you cannot disable them.
</Callout>


### 4) Choose your Search Provider (Optional)
One of the tools agents have is `Web-Browsing` which allows agents to browse the internet. 

Currently we support two search providers [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Serper](https://serper.dev/)

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    You can ignore this step if you don't plan to use the `Web-Browsing` tool
</Callout>
