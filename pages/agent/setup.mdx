<Callout type="error" emoji="️⚠️">
  **Caution**

    Not all LLM Models works well as Agents, you may need to use higher quantization models for better responses.
    Example: `Llama 3 8B 8Bit Quantization` gives better responses as an Agent
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    AnythingLLM supports a lot of LLM providers for use with `@agent`s and you can see all the supported LLMs from [here](https://docs.useanything.com/features/language-models#supported-language-model-providers)
</Callout>


### 3) Choose your Agent skills

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    Some tools like `RAG`, `Summarize Documents` and `Scrape Websites` are enabled by default and you cannot disable them.
</Callout>


### 4) Choose your Search Provider (Optional)
One of the tools agents can use is `Web-Browsing` which allows agents to browse the internet. 

Currently we support the following search providers:
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) 
- [Serper](https://serper.dev/)
- [Bing Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/bing-entity-search-api/)

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    You can ignore this step if you don't plan to use the `Web-Browsing` tool
</Callout>
