# LMStudio LLM

[LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai) is a popular user-interface, API, and LLM engine that allows you to download any GGUF model from HuggingFace and run it on CPU or GPU.

LMStudio is a _separate_ application that you need to download first and connect to.

## Connecting to LMStudio

When running LMStudio locally, you **should** connect to LMStudio by first running the built-in inference server.

You can update your model to a different model at any time in the **Settings**.
