# Azure OpenAI LLM

Microsoft Azure OpenAI offers the same LLM models the base [OpenAI provider](openai) does, but running on your Azure account with all privacy and agreements pertaining to that subscription.

## Connecting to Azure OpenAI

  **Valid account setup required!**

    You must have a valid [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) subscription set up to use this integration.

It is possible to use Microsoft Azure for your LLM chat model.

This allows you to use GPT models in a private and enterprise environment that is managed by Microsoft.

You can update your model to a different model at any time in the **Settings**.
