# Chroma Cloud

[Chroma](https://trychroma.com) is an [open-source](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) and ai-native vector database that is easy to run and host anywhere. Chroma Cloud is a hosted version of Chroma that is easy to use and setup.

AnythingLLM can connect to your Chroma Cloud instance so that AnythingLLM can store and search embeddings on it automatically.

## Connecting to Chroma Cloud

  **Developer Notice**

    Make sure to create a database in Chroma Cloud prior to connecting.

    AnythingLLM will use the embedding model set and **will not** use Chroma's built-in embedders even if defined.

    If you run into any issues please visit Chroma Cloud's [documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/cloud/getting-started).
