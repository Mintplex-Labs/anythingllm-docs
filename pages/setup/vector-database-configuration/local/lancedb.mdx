# Lance DB Vector Database

LanceDB can scale to millions of vectors all on disk with zero configuration and incredible retrieval speed.

  **HEADS UP!**

    By default, AnythingLLM will use an open-source on-instance of [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) vector database so that your document text and embeddings never leave the AnythingLLM application.

## Connecting to Lance DB

There is no configuration or options required for LanceDB
