# Chroma Vector Database

[Chroma](https://trychroma.com) is an [open-source](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) and ai-native vector database that is easy to run and host anywhere.

AnythingLLM can connect to your local or cloud-hosted Chroma instance running so that AnythingLLM can store and search embeddings on it automatically.

## Connecting to Chroma Vector Database

<Callout type="warning" emoji="️⚠️">
  **Developer Notice**

    Chroma [requires a server](https://docs.trychroma.com/usage-guide#running-chroma-in-clientserver-mode) to be running so that Chroma can embed or index your embeddings automatically.

    AnythingLLM will use the embedding model set and **will not** use Chroma's built-in embedders even if defined.

</Callout>

You can configure Chroma at any time in the **Settings**.
