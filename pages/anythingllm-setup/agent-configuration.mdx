# AI Agent
Agents are basically an LLM that has access to some simple tools. 

We will be adding much more customization in this area soon, but basically they work inside a workspace.


## Setting up AI Agents

### 1) Go to Agent configuration
On workspace settings, go to the agent configuration menu

### 2) Choose the LLM for your Agent
On workspace settings, select your LLM Provider and the Model you want your Agent to use.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️⚠️">
  **Caution**

    Not all LLM Models works well as Agents, you need to use higher quantization models for better responses.
    Example: `Llama 3 8B 8Bit Quantization Model` gives better responses as an Agent
</Callout>

  **Note**

    Agents supports lot of LLM providers and you can see all the supported LLMs from [here](https://docs.useanything.com/features/language-models#supported-language-model-providers)

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    Some tools like `RAG`, `Summarize Documents` and `Scrape Websites` are enabled by default and you cannot disable them.
</Callout>


### 4) Choose your Search Provider (Optional)
One of the tools agents have is `Web-Browsing` which allows agents to browse the internet. 

Currently we support two search providers [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Serper](https://serper.dev/)

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
  **Note**

    You can ignore this step if you don't plan to use the `Web-Browsing` tool
</Callout>
