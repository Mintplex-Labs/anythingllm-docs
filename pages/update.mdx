## Updating on MacOS

### Updating using Installation file

Simply download the latest version of the installation `dmg` from the [download page](https://useanything.com/download) and then re-install the app and it will overwrite the existing application while persisting your storage and progress.

### Updating using Homebrew

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Note:** ➤➤ You can only update using Homebrew if you initially installed
  AnythingLLM using Homebrew.
</Callout>

Simply run the below command on your terminal

```shell copy
 brew update && brew upgrade --cask anythingllm
```

This command will overwrite the existing application with the new version while persisting your storage and progress.

---

## Updating on Windows

Simply download the latest version of the installation `.exe` from the [download page](https://useanything.com/download) and then re-install the app and it will overwrite the existing application while persisting your storage and progress.

---

## Updating on Linux

Simply download the latest version of the installation `.AppImage` from the [download page](https://useanything.com/download) and then execute this new `.AppImage` and delete the old one. This will persist your data, but allow you to use the latest version of the software.

---

## Updating on Docker

- Stop the container currently running AnythingLLM so the port is freed.
- `docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm` to pull the latest image.
- Restart the container pointed at the same storage location defined during previous boot.

You should always deploy or start the AnythingLLM container using the command found in [our local docker setup](/installation/self-hosted/local-docker#recommend-way-to-run-dockerized-anythingllm)
