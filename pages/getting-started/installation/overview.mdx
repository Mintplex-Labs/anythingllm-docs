## Installation Overview

AnythingLLM is a "**single-player**" application you can install on any Mac, Windows, or Linux operating system and get local LLMs, RAG, and Agents with little to zero configuration and full privacy.

You can install AnythingLLM as a Desktop Application, Self Host it locally using Docker and Host it on cloud (aws, google cloud, railway etc..) using Docker


## Docker vs Desktop Version

AnythingLLM offers two main ways to use AnythingLLM. There are some distinct differences in functionality between each offering. Both are open source.

- You do not need multi-user support
- Everything needs to stay only on your device
- You do not need to "publish" anything to the public internet. Eg: Chat widget for website


### You want AnythingLLM Docker if...

- You need an easy setup, but server-based service for AnythingLLM to use local LLMs, RAG, and Agents locally
- You want to run an AnythingLLM instance that many people can use at the same time
- You want to be able to share information with our users on your instance you invite
- You need admin and rule-based access for workspaces and documents.
- You will publish chat widgets to the public internet
- You want to access AnythingLLM from the browser
