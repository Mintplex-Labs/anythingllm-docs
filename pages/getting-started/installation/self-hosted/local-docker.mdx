# Run AnythingLLM locally using Docker

Running AnythingLLM locally is the most comprehensive way to run AnythingLLM with its full feature suite.

The easiest way to install AnythingLLM is to use [Docker](https://docker.com) on your local machine or server. 

[**See system requirements**](/getting-started/installation/system-requirements)

Once you are prepared to run AnythingLLM on your machine the process is quite simple. You should provision a folder somewhere on the host machine so that you can re-pull the latest versions of AnythingLLM and persist data between container rebuilds.


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**

    The Mintplex Labs team takes great care to ensure AnythingLLM is always backward compatible. 

    In the event this changes you will be alerted via code, deployment, or our regular communication channels on social, Discord, and email.
