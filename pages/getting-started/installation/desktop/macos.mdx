# MacOS Installation

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Install the right dmg!**

    Make sure you downloaded the correct `dmg` for your device! We support both types of chips found in MacOS devices.

    Apple Silicon devices (M1/M2/M3) - `AnythingLLMDesktop-AppleSilicon.dmg`

    Apple (Intel) - `AnythingLLMDesktop.dmg`
</Callout>


<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **PERFORMANCE**

    Apple M-Series chips run local LLM inferencing **considerably** faster than Intel-based Mac.
</Callout>


## Downloading the application

Here is the download links for the latest version of Anything LLM MacOS.

Your internet browser may need you to verify you want to download and run the AnythingLLM Desktop app since it may be marked as "untrusted" depending on your browser security settings. 

Click "**Keep**" when downloading to allow the file to download.

## Installing the application

After downloading the `.dmg` file from the link in the invitation email, you will want to double-click on the resulting installed file.

Once the dmg opens, you can drag the AnythingLLM logo into `Applications`

Once installed, you will find AnythingLLM in your Applications folder as well as you can use `cmd + spacebar` and type in AnythingLLM to run.


## Uninstalling the Application

In the `Finder` you can drag the application into the `Trashcan` and the application will be uninstalled.

To remove all AnythingLLM desktop data from your system please also remove the `/Library/Application Support/anythingllm-desktop` folder. That folder is where your database, documents, and vector cache are located.


## Updating the Application

Simply download the latest version of the `dmg` from the beta download page and then re-install the app and it will overwrite the existing application while persisting your storage and progress.


##  Debugging & Other Tips

All of your documents, vectors, and database will be stored in the `~/Library/Application Support/anythingllm-desktop` folder. Should you uninstall the application, you should remove this folder as well as it still contains your application's data should you install it again.

To run the AnythingLLM Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/Applications/AnythingLLM/Content/MacOs` where you can then run the executable and see all application logs while running AnythingLLM.
