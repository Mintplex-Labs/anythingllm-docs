  **Warning:**
  If you are not a developer, you should not set environment variables directly. Instead, you should use the in-app interface to manage environment variables.

**Desktop:**
If you are using AnythingLLM Desktop, do not edit the `.env` file. This guide is only for users who are using AnythingLLM Self-hosted or Docker.

# Configuration of AnythingLLM

In general, the majority of configurations you can set are through environment variables and there is typically an associated in-app interface to manage these settings so you don't have to edit them directly.

However, there are a few configurations that are not configurable via the in-app interface and require you to set environment variables directly. These are usually for more niche use cases that most users will not need.

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **Tip:** After you set these environment variables, you will need to restart
  the AnythingLLM service or container for the changes to take effect.

## Disable View Chat History

Modification of the `DISABLE_VIEW_CHAT_HISTORY` environment variable allows you to disable the **frontend** ability to view chat history by anyone with an account on the instance as well as the instance administrator.
This blocks any user, including yourself, from viewing chat history from users using the AnythingLLM chat interface **and** via external embed widgets.

- **This does not impact users from seeing their own chat histories in chat or the LLM from being able to use them for continuous conversations.**
- This **does not** impact the ability to use API keys to access chat histories via the associated API endpoints.
- This will impact the ability to export chat histories via the in-app interface as well as the ability to delete chat histories.
- **Chat history is not deleted when this is enabled. It is simply hidden and blocked from being viewed via the frontend admin interfaces.**

### Enable

Set the `DISABLE_VIEW_CHAT_HISTORY` environment variable to **_any value_** to enable.

```bash
# This can be any value, number, boolean, or string and it will have the same effect.
DISABLE_VIEW_CHAT_HISTORY="enable"
```

### Disable

Fully remove or comment out the `DISABLE_VIEW_CHAT_HISTORY` environment variable to return to the default behavior.
