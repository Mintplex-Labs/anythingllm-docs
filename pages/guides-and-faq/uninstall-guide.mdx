One of the commonly asked question on our discord server is how to properly uninstall anythingllm.
We have mentioned the uninstallation steps on the Installation page but lot of people didn't know it exists there as the page title says Intsallation.
So we have to remove the uninstallation steps from installation page and put it here on this file */}
