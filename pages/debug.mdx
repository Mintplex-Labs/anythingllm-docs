## AnythingLLM Debug mode on MacOS

To run the AnythingLLM Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/Applications/AnythingLLM/Content/MacOs` where you can then run the executable and see all application logs while running AnythingLLM.

## AnythingLLM Debug mode on Windows

To run the AnythingLLM Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a CMD or Powershell window and run the path to the AnythingLLM executable. Typically this is in `C:\Users\usr\AppData\Local\Programs\anythingllm-desktop\AnythingLLMDesktop.exe`.
This will print all logs to the powershell window while running and should display a verbose error once encountered that is critical for debugging.

## AnythingLLM Debug mode on Linux

To run the AnythingLLM Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/.config/anythingllm-desktop/AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage` where you can then run the executable and see all AppImage logs while running AnythingLLM.

## AnythingLLM Debug mode on Docker

Open `Container Logs` in Docker desktop or print the logs via `docker container <CONTAINER_ID> logs`
