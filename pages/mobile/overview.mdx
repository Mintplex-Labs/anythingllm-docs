### Common Questions

#### IOS support?

We are planning to support iOS in the future. Currently, we are focusing on Android for a full release by the end of September 2025. iOS support coming after that in October 2025.

#### Can I download any model I want?

Right now, for performance reasons, we only support a hand-picked models. Eventually we will support any model you want, but for now, we are focusing on performance and stability.

#### How does syncing with AnythingLLM Desktop & Cloud work?

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  Requires _version 1.8.5_ or higher of AnythingLLM Desktop or AnythingLLM Cloud. In 1.8.5, this feature is hidden behind the ["Experimental features"](/beta-preview/enable-feature) sidebar item.
</Callout>

AnythingLLM Mobile while functional and complete standalone, is designed to be also be a companion to AnythingLLM Desktop and AnythingLLM Cloud.

Since mobile devices have limited resources, we now have the ability to sync your chats, workspaces, and threads with AnythingLLM Desktop or AnythingLLM Cloud/Self-hosted instances in addition
to being able to **delegate** inference across your local network or cloud instances for more compute and more powerful models, but in the mobile form factor!

This technology is called **Distributed Inference**<sup>TM</sup> and is a key part of AnythingLLM's vision for the future of local AI.

#### How does the on device RAG work?

AnythingLLM Mobile runs a small embedding model + local vector database on your device to provide RAG capabilities with citations.

#### How can I add my own agent tools?

Currently, to use custom agent tools, MCPs or otherwise, you should use the sync feature with AnythingLLM Desktop or AnythingLLM Cloud. Customization of agent tools on mobile standalone is not yet supported.
