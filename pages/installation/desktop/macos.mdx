# MacOS Installation

There are **three** ways to install AnythingLLM on MacOS

**[1. Install using the Installation `.dmg` file](#install-using-the-installation-file)**

**[2. Install using Homebrew](#install-using-homebrew)**

**[3. Install using Docker](#install-using-docker)**

## Install using the installation file

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Install the right dmg!**

➤ Make sure you downloaded the correct `dmg` for your device! We support both types of chips found in MacOS devices.

➤ Apple Silicon devices (M1/M2/M3) - `AnythingLLMDesktop-AppleSilicon.dmg`

➤ Apple (Intel) - `AnythingLLMDesktop.dmg`

</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  **PERFORMANCE** ➤➤ Apple M-Series chips run local LLM inferencing
  **considerably** faster than Intel-based Mac.

 touch "$STORAGE_LOCATION/.env" && \
 docker run -d -p 3001:3001 \
