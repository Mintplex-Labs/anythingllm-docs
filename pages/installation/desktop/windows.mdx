# Windows Installation

There are **two** ways to install AnythingLLM on Windows

**[1. Install using the Installation `.exe` file](#install-using-the-installation-file)**

**[2. Install using Docker](#install-using-docker)**

## Install using the installation file

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Application is not signed!**

➤ The AnythingLLM windows application is currently unsigned and Windows defender or other anti-virus software will sometimes flag the application as malicious.

➤ If you do not want to bypass that alert for any reason - please use AnythingLLM another way.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="️⚠️">
  **OPERATING SYSTEM NOTICE**

></Card>

export const Card = Object.assign(
  // Copy card component and add default props
  Cards.Card.bind(),

    defaultProps: {

## Install using Docker

Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine, if you don't have Docker installed then you can install it by following this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Run this command on your terminal (powershell or command prompt)

```shell copy
 docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm
```

It will pull in the latest AnythingLLM image from docker.

Once you have pulled the latest image, run the following commands on your powershell

```powershell copy showLineNumbers
 $env:STORAGE_LOCATION="$HOME\Documents\anythingllm"; `
 If(!(Test-Path $env:STORAGE_LOCATION)) {New-Item $env:STORAGE_LOCATION -ItemType Directory}; `
 If(!(Test-Path "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env")) {New-Item "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env" -ItemType File}; `
 docker run -d -p 3001:3001 `
 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN `
 -v "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION`:/app/server/storage" `
 -v "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env:/app/server/.env" `
 -e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" `
 mintplexlabs/anythingllm;
```

The above command will mount the storage locally and run AnythingLLM in Docker

Now go to `http://localhost:3001` on your browser and you are now using AnythingLLM!

All your data and progress will persist between container rebuilds or pulls from Docker Hub.
