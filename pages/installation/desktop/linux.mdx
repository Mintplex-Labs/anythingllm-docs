# Linux Installation

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **OPERATING SYSTEM NOTICE**

    AnythingLLM is built on an Ubuntu system and may not work well on other distros. 

    Please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/issues) if you have installation or bootup troubles. 

    We want to have Linux OS's to have the same experience with AnythingLLM.
</Callout>


## Downloading the application

Here is the download links for the latest version of Anything LLM Linux.

    href="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public.useanything.com/latest/AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage"> 
  </Card>
</Cards>

export const Card = Object.assign(
  // Copy card component and add default props
  Cards.Card.bind(),
  {
    displayName: 'Card',
    defaultProps: {
      image: false,
      arrow: true,
      target: '_blank'
    }
  }
)


Your internet browser may need you to verify you want to download and run the AnythingLLM Desktop app since it may be marked as "untrusted" depending on your browser security settings. 

Click "**Keep**" when downloading to allow the file to download.

## Installing the application

After downloading the Linux `.AppImage` for AnythingLLM, you may need to give the file executable permissions so that it can run.

```shell copy "
chmod a+x /Downloads/AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage
```

After that, you can boot the AppImage like any other app image. Double-clicking or running via the terminal will boot the full application.

```shell copy showLineNumbers"
# Assuming we are running the AppImage from the /Downloads folder.
./AnythingLLMDesktop.AppImage
# This will run the application in this terminal pane. It will show all logs.
```

## Uninstalling the Linux application

Remove the `.AppImage` from your machine. Done. See the instructions below to remove all associated data.


## Clear data from previous installations

To completely clear all application data from your system like your local database, documents, and vector cache you can delete the folder located in `/home/{user}/.config/anythingllm-desktop`

You can delete the entire directory or just the storage folder to reset your current install.


## Updating your application

As new releases are made available, you can simply download the latest `.AppImage` from the beta download page and then execute this new appImage and delete the old one. This will persist your data, but allow you to use the latest version of the software.
