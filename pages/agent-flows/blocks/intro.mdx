  If you expect to use a block in your flow, but it is not available - you are probably using the wrong version of AnythingLLM.

  <u>**Please do not open a support ticket about a missing block without first checking the block docs.**</u><br/>
  
  If a block is only available on AnythingLLM Desktop, we will show a warning on the block's doc page. Otherwise, you can assume the block is available in all versions of AnythingLLM.

## Overview

Learn about the blocks that are available to you in the flow editor. Keep in mind that the blocks available to you will vary depending on the type of deployment of AnythingLLM you are using.

## Available Blocks

{Object.keys(META).filter((key) => key !== "intro").map((key) => {
return (

<Card
  key={key}
  title={META[key].title}
  href={`/agent-flows/blocks/${key}`}
  style={{ margin: "1rem" }}
/>
); })}

export const Card = Object.assign(
  // Copy card component and add default props
  Cards.Card.bind(),
  {
    displayName: "Card",
    defaultProps: {
      image: true,
      arrow: true,
      target: "_self",
    },
  }
);
