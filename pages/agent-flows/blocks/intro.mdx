<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  If you expect to use a block in your flow, but it is not available - you are probably using the wrong version of AnythingLLM.

  <u>**Please do not open a support ticket about a missing block without first checking the block docs.**</u><br/>
  
  If a block is only available on AnythingLLM Desktop, we will show a warning on the block's doc page. Otherwise, you can assume the block is available in all versions of AnythingLLM.
