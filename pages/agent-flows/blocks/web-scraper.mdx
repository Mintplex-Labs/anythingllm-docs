## Usage

The web scraper block is used to scrape a website and extract the content. Currently the web-scraper will return the parsed TEXT content of the page - not the HTML.

The purpose of this block is to allow you to scrape a website and extract the content you need as if you were accessing the website directly. If you are looking for more programmatic access to the HTML, you should use the [API call block](/agent-flows/blocks/api-call).

## Input Variables

- `URL to scrape`: The URL of the website to scrape.
- `Result Variable`: The variable to store the result of the web scraping.
