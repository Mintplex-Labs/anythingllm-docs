# Agent Flows

Agent Flows are a no-code way to build [agentic skills](../agent/overview.mdx). Using a visual interface, you can build "flows" that can be used in your agents.

The capabilities of agent flows are only limited by your imagination and the tools you have access to. Docker and Desktop versions of AnythingLLM have a built-in agent flow editor and
have various tools available to use in your flows. In general, the desktop version has more tools available to use in your flows.

## Agent Flows vs Agent skills

In general, agent flows are a more simplified way to build custom agent skills than the traditional [agent skills](../agent/overview.mdx) method. The end result is the same, but the
process of building the skill is different.

- **Agent flows:** No-code way to build agentic skills. Built for everyone.
- **Agent skills:** Code way to build agentic skills. Built for power users and developers.

## How to use agent flows

Agent flows _work exactly the same_ as agent skills, the only difference is the way you build them. You can use agent flows in the same way you use agent skills via the `@agent` directive or by asking
a relevant question while in an agentic chat.

Agent flows are a very flexible way to build agentic skills and depending on the power of your LLM, you can even expect
the LLM to _chain multiple flows together_ to complete a task, or call a series of flows in a row to complete a task.
