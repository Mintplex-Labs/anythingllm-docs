# Getting Started with Flows

Let's walk through how to access and use the flow builder in AnythingLLM.

## Accessing the Flow Builder

To create a new flow, navigate to your workspace's agent skills page and click the "Create Flow" button. This will open the flow builder with a blank canvas.

  height={1080}
  width={1920}
  quality={100}
  alt="UI when no flows exist"
/>

## Understanding the Canvas

When you first open the flow builder, you'll see a blank canvas with some basic blocks. These are the foundation of every flow:

/>

### Default Blocks

Every new flow starts with three essential blocks:

1. **Flow Information Block** - Defines the flow's name and description
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/images/agent-flows/flow-info.png"
    height={200}
    width={500}
    quality={100}
  />
</div>

2. **Flow Variables Block** - Sets up any variables needed in your flow
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/images/agent-flows/flow-vars.png"
    height={200}
    width={500}
    quality={100}
  />
</div>

3. **Flow Complete Block** - Marks the end of your flow
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/images/agent-flows/flow-complete.png"
    height={200}
    width={500}
    quality={100}
  />
</div>

You can learn more about these blocks in the [Default Blocks documentation](/agent-flows/blocks/default-blocks).

## Adding New Blocks

To add functionality to your flow, you'll need to add blocks. Click the "Add Block" button between any existing blocks to see available options:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image
    src="/images/agent-flows/add-block.png"
    height={200}
    width={500}
    quality={100}
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Available blocks will vary depending on your AnythingLLM version. Check the [blocks documentation](/agent-flows/blocks/intro) to see which blocks are available in your deployment.
</Callout>

## Saving and Managing Flows

- All new flows are automatically saved as "Enabled"
- Click the "Save" button in the top right to save changes
- Access existing flows from the agent skills page
- Click the gear icon on a flow to edit or delete it
