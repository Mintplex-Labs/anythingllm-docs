## Notable Improvements: 🚀

**Installer Optimization**<br />
Now, on Windows and MacOS we will not attempt to reinstall dependencies if they are already installed. This speeds up installation time significantly. We also made some improvements to the installer to
shrink the installer size even though we are still packing more features!

---

**Docker Model Runner**<br />
We now have first class support for running models via the [Docker Model Runner & MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/). If you have the latest Docker Desktop installed you can use Docker for models and MCP servers!
