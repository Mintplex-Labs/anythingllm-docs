## What's New:

- [x] Reranker added for workspace RAG (LanceDB only)
- [x] Support attachmets via threadWorkspace API endpoints
- [x] Added support for Gemini text embedder

#### Windows ARM64 - Snapdragon X Elite devices only

By default, on Windows ARM64 devices that have the Snapdragon X Elite chipset, AnythingLLM is now able to download and run LLMs on the built-in NPU. This is a huge efficiency boost for any workspace that uses RAG.

Additionally, the default embedder model is able to run on the NPU as well with a 30% performance increase in embedding documents.
