## What's New:

### AMD GPU Support + More

Our internal Ollama provider was bumped to the latest version (0.3.14) which includes support for AMD GPUs, as well as other improvements.

For Windows, we install the additional support files during the [installation process](../installation-desktop/windows.mdx) automatically.
For MacOS, there is nothing to do.

### Import any Ollama Model Tag or Hugging Face Model

You can now import any Ollama model tag or Hugging Face model into AnythingLLM using the default Ollama provider. Simply enter the tag or URL and hit import.
This allows you to use models that are not explicitly listed in the UI.

Just paste in the `ollama run` command and hit import!

Pulling from [Ollama.com](https://ollama.com/library)
example: `ollama run mistral-nemo`

Pulling from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/ollama)
example: `ollama run hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF`

### Computer Use (Anthropic AI)

AnythingLLM can now leverage the new [Anthropic AI Computer Use]() models.

This is an [experimental feature](https://docs.anythingllm.com/beta-preview/active-features/computer-use) and must be explicitly enabled in your system settings.
