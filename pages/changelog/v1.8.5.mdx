When we first launched AnythingLLM the average local model context window was around 2K tokens. Now that local models are very powerful with 16K+ context windows it is time we overhaul our file UX.

Now, in AnythingLLM Desktop chatting with files is a breeze. When available we will now use the **full** file content to answer your questions when your model's context window is appropriate.

If you upload a file that is too large to fit in the context window, we will ask you to embed the file instead (RAG). If you want to have a file only for RAG, you can do that too via the regular file upload window on the workspace.

Now you can have the best of both worlds. Read more about this change [here](/chatting-with-documents/introduction#rag-vs-attached-documents).
