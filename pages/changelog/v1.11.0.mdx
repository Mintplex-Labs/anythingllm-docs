## AnythingLLM Desktop Assistant is live!

The AnythingLLM Desktop Assistant is live! The desktop assistant is a context-aware assistant that lives across your entire OS. 

In a single keystroke, you can open the Desktop Assistant and start chatting, creating agents, and more with full context from any open applications as well as all other chat functionality in AnythingLLM.

## Onboarding Improvements

We have made some improvements to the onboarding process to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. Now, on a fresh install of AnythingLLM Desktop, we will suggest the best model for your hardware and system for the most optimal performance and experience.

By default, this will always be an on-device multi-modal model. You can still choose any other model or provider if you prefer. This does not impact your ability to customize what LLM provider and model you want in settings or per-workspace.
