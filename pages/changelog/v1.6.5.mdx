<Callout type="danger">
  **Hotfix Available** This version was patched in [1.6.6](./v1.6.6.mdx) -
  please use that version before submitting a bug on GitHub or Discord.
</Callout>

## What's New:

- [**AnythingLLM Browser Extension:**](../browser-extension/install.mdx) Send and embed information from the web directly to AnythingLLM or embed directly into your workspaces for later!
- [**Custom Agent Skills:**](../agent/custom/introduction.mdx) Create fully custom agent skills to extend the capabilities of your `@agent` invocations.
- [Better logging](../debug.mdx) for debugging.
- You can now use `@agent` to run skills via the developer API.

**Potential Breaking Change:**

- By default, AnythingLLM will boot up on `localhost` and not `0.0.0.0` - which may be required if you are using the Desktop App developer API over LAN via private IP connection. You can change this in the system settings of the app.

## Fixes & Improvements:

- Fixed bug on windows where dragging and dropping files would embed, but not show as embedded in the UI.
- Default profile picture are less ugly now.
- Model provider updates (Gemini, Perplexity, Voyage AI, etc)
- Milvus bug fix
- Escape key to close document uploader
- `SearchApi` agent web browsing support
- Removal of `@agent` popup for first time users.
- Removal of Fine-tuning alert from UI.

## What's Next:

- Custom workspace icons and user avatars.
- Community Hub for sharing custom agent skills, workspaces, prompts, etc.
