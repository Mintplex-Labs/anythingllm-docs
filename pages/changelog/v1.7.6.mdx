## What's New:

### Reorder workspaces
You can now reorder your workspaces by dragging and dropping them into your desired order.

### Ollama 0.6.2
The internal version of Ollama has been updated to 0.6.2

_note:_ There is a known issue with ollama 0.6.2 where `gemma3` does not work. We will patch this when it is fixed in Ollama.

### Installer skip
_windows only_

We've added an option to skip instllation of the ollama libraries when installing AnythingLLM. This is useful if you plan to not use the internal ollama shipped with AnythingLLM and want to save disk space and time.
