## Performance & Privacy

### Privacy

All processing is done locally on your device - 100% free with no limits. We download the transcription and other small models to support this feature
as needed on the first time a file is uploaded or a recording is made. These models are stored locally on your device for re-use.

Your meetings, recordings, and other files are never uploaded to our servers. They are all processed locally on your device and never leave your device.

### Performance

The Meeting Assistant is designed to be fast and efficient as possible on all ranges of hardware. That being said, your experience and speeds may vary depending on your hardware and the length of the meeting.

We currently have dedicated hardware to support that is highly performant on:
- Apple Silicon M-Series CPUs
- NVIDIA RTX GPUs

All other hardware is supported, but may not be as performant, but will still work and run exclusively on CPU.

### Supported Platforms
- [x] MacOS Silicon (M-Series)
- [x] MacOS Intel
- [x] Windows x64
- [x] Windows ARM64
- [-] Linux x64 (Coming Soon)
- [-] Linux ARM64 (Coming Soon)

### Minimum System Requirements

We recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM to run the Meeting Assistant. All CPU architectures are supported.
