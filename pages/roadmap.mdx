# The Roadmap

At AnythingLLM, we're dedicated to making the most advanced LLM application available to everyone. We want to empower everyone to be able leverage LLMs for their own use for both non-technical and technical users.

With the community's help, we're making progress towards our goals and this roadmap is a guide for what we're working on and what we plan to work on.

This roadmap is not set in stone and is subject to change. We welcome any feedback and suggestions from the community as that is what ultimately drives the product roadmap.

**This is for tracking high-level features. Other tracking is done via our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/issues).**
