# Model Context Protocol (MCP) in AnythingLLM

AnythingLLM supports the all [Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-spec) for use with [AI Agents](/agent/overview).

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) to enable seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.

There are [many tools](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) that exist already built with MCP in mind and AnythingLLM can work with any of them.

> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## How to use MCP in AnythingLLM

MCP Servers can be added to AnythingLLM by editing the `anythingllm_mcp_servers.json` configuration file in your AnythingLLM storage `plugins` directory.

The structure of the file is the same as the [MCP Server Specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#using-an-mcp-client).

AnythingLLM will automatically detect the MCP Servers and attempt to boot them up as needed - you can also manage your servers directly in the AnythingLLM UI.

### AnythingLLM MCP Configuration UI

  alt="Model Context Protocol"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "12px",
    margin: "10px auto",
  }}
/>

The MCP Management UI will show you all the MCP Servers that are available to use in AnythingLLM. You can also:
- Reload/Restart all MCP Servers from the configuration file (if changes are made)
- View the status of the MCP Servers found
- View error logs from the MCP Servers
- Stop or start the MCP Servers on the fly
- View all available tools from the MCP Servers loaded successfully
- Delete the MCP Servers (will remove the server from the configuration file)

### Example configuration file

_this file will be automatically generated in the proper directory if it doesn't exist before it is needed. It will be empty by default._

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "face-generator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@dasheck0/face-generator"
      ]
    },
    "mcp-youtube": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-youtube"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
